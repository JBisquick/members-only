# odin-members-only

This project creates a members only messaging board. Those who are members can see who posted and when. 

# How it's Made:

**Tech Used:** NodeJS, Express, EJS, and Mongoose.

I used authentication to allow those who signed up to see messages, those who are members to see who posted the messages, and those who are admins to delete messages.

# Lesson's Learned:

This project taught me how to use authentication on a website. I learned how to create a sign-up and log-in page. I learned how to use local strategies to keep someone logged on to the website. I also learned how to give different users different permissions on the website.
